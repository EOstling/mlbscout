	0) Scouting web app that fulfills the hole left by the MLB bureu scout service.
	The core idea being that the web app provides general information on player
	tangibles in addition to where and when their team is playing. This helps the scout
	be more effective getting to more players in less time. Validated High School
	coaches will be able to submit information like rosters and schedules in order to
	promote their players and team. Players will benefit
	1) Team Scout: Uses the web app to find general information on a player as well as
	finding where said player has a game and if player is playing.
	HS coach: Uses the web app to get his players noticed who wouldn't normally be while growing
	his team be it school or travel team.
	College Coach: Uses the web app to find general information on a player as well as
	finding where said player has a game and for recruiting purposes. Also get's players
	noticed that might not be(especially for DIII and DII coaches)
	Players: The web app provides them with more publicity and noteriety that they
	would not be getting other wise.
	2) Team Scout: As a team scout I want to find where a player is playing.
	As a team scout I want to find the player tangibles
	Hs Coach: As a hs coach I want to post the tangible information about my players.
	College Coach: As a college coach I want to post about my players as well as
	find out hs recruits tangibles.3) Team Scout Use Case:
	Joe has just finished watching a weekday college game in Eugene Oregon. He's staying in a hotel
	and pulls out his laptop. He goes to the web app and searches for a game that is within
	driving distance of his hotel for tomorrow. He clicks on the game and then clicks on
	each team to see about any players he may be interested in scouting Based on that
	information he decides which game he will be going to but it's farther away then he
	was planning. The next day he pulls up the game on his phone and clicks on the
	game location which then opens up google maps to give him directions to the game
	as well as traffic info to get there on time.
