	<h2>Age: 32</h2>
	<h2>Profession:</h2>
		<p>Chris Cook is a professional baseball scout for a Major League Baseball Team. His job is to find talent in his assigned region in order for his team to draft and sign the talent to a professional contract.

	<h2>Attitudes and Behaviors</h2>
		<p>Chris never has a day off. During the weekdays traveling to local high school and college games based around the city he lives in. During the weekends traveling to out of state games in his region which are primarily college 3 game series .</p>
	<h2>Frustrations and Needs:</h2>
		<p>Chris' main concern is that he needs to know when his favorite players are playing as well as potential players he will be interested in.

Being organized and having a quick reference to when and where players are playing is essential to seeing as many players as possible. He has to travel hundreds of miles to see players and being organized allows him to see as many players as possible.
