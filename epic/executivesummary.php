		<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
		<p>Scouting web app that fulfills the hole left by the MLB bureau scout service.
			The core idea being that the web app provides general information on player
			tangibles in addition to where and when their team is playing. This helps the scout
			be more effective getting to more players in less time. Validated High School
			coaches will be able to submit information like rosters and schedules in order to
			promote their players and team. Players will benefit from this service in that it
			will provide college and major league scouts with all the information they
			need to be able to invest their time in the players. </p>
